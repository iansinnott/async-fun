# Async Fun

My repository for playing around with Rx

## What

I created a number of branches here with various Rx implementations as I was learning. Check out the branches for more.

## UI Library

As part of this project I created a very simple declarative UI library conceptually similar to React. This was just a fun aside although it could be refactored into a standalone library if desired. A better implementation would be a virtual DOM, more like React, that doesn't depend on `document.createElement`. See `src/dom.js` for the implementation.

## Dev

* `npm run start`: Start dev server with live reload
* `npm run build`: Build the project
